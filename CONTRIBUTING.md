## Git Guidelines

In case you're unfamiliar with git as a source control tool, here's a (hopefully) helpful guidebook to getting code committed and merged without too much heartache!

Shared Use is using the Git Flow model, which is based around a single repository with multiple branches. Most important of these are the `master` and `dev` branches.

`master` is where code goes before it is released. It's been reviewed and tested, and is generally in a pretty stable state.

`dev` is the development where new features are placed when they are ready.

### Creating a Feature Branch

To get started working on a new feature, first you need a branch to place your shiny new code. For example this guide is being developed under the name `shared-use-git-guide` from the `dev` branch:

```
git checkout dev
git checkout -b shared-use-git-guide
```

### Writing & Committing Code

Now you write your code just as before. When you're ready to save your progress, just commit:

```

```
